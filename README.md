This project presents an adaptive approach to the classic Banker's Algorithm by incorporating dynamic safety verification into resource allocation. Designed for multi-process environments, it simulates concurrent processes that request, execute, and release resources, ensuring that each allocation maintains system safety and prevents deadlocks.
Key Features
Dynamic Safety Checks:
Before granting any resource request, the algorithm simulates the process execution to confirm that the allocation will not lead to an unsafe state.

Multi-Threaded Simulation:
Implemented in C using pthreads and mutex locks, the project accurately mimics concurrent process execution and resource management in real-time.

Comprehensive Resource Management:
Uses matrices to monitor allocated resources, maximum resource requirements, and the remaining needs of each process, ensuring efficient distribution and usage of resources.

Robust Synchronization:
Employs advanced thread synchronization techniques to manage resource allocation, execution, and release seamlessly, avoiding race conditions and ensuring data integrity.

Implementation Details
Algorithm Enhancement:
Building on the traditional Banker's Algorithm, this project introduces real-time safety checks to simulate the sequence of process executions. This ensures that every resource allocation keeps the system in a safe state.
Future Directions
Scalability Enhancements:
Further optimize the algorithm to efficiently manage larger numbers of processes and resources, possibly through improved data structures or parallel processing techniques.

Visualization Tools:
Integrate graphical or console-based visualization components to represent the resource allocation process and safe sequences, making it easier to analyze and debug system behavior.

Advanced Logging and Error Handling:
Develop comprehensive logging mechanisms and robust error handling to track system performance, identify issues promptly, and support ongoing improvements.

Real-World Integration:
Explore the potential to incorporate this enhanced algorithm into actual operating systems or simulation environments, bridging the gap between academic theory and practical applications.


Process Simulation:
Each process is represented by a thread that follows a workflow: it requests resources, simulates execution (via timed delays), and then releases the resources. A safe sequence is maintained throughout to guarantee deadlock prevention.

Modular Code Structure:
The code is divided into distinct sections—initialization, safety verification, process execution, and cleanup—to enhance readability, maintainability, and ease of debugging.
