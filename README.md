This project presents an adaptive approach to the classic Banker's Algorithm by incorporating dynamic safety verification into resource allocation. Designed for multi-process environments, it simulates concurrent processes that request, execute, and release resources, ensuring that each allocation maintains system safety and prevents deadlocks.
Key Features
Dynamic Safety Checks:
Before granting any resource request, the algorithm simulates the process execution to confirm that the allocation will not lead to an unsafe state.

Multi-Threaded Simulation:
Implemented in C using pthreads and mutex locks, the project accurately mimics concurrent process execution and resource management in real-time.

Comprehensive Resource Management:
Uses matrices to monitor allocated resources, maximum resource requirements, and the remaining needs of each process, ensuring efficient distribution and usage of resources.

Robust Synchronization:
Employs advanced thread synchronization techniques to manage resource allocation, execution, and release seamlessly, avoiding race conditions and ensuring data integrity.
