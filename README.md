# Dynamic-Safety-Driven-Resource-Allocation-An-Enhanced-Banker-s-Algorithm-Approach
This project extends the classic Banker's Algorithm by incorporating dynamic safety verification for resource allocation in a multi-process environment. It simulates a system where concurrent processes request, execute, and release resources, ensuring that every allocation maintains the system's safe state and effectively prevents deadlocks.
